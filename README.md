# Statistic-Project
 
The main objective of this project was to study the consequences of the pandemic on Brazilian education by comparing the academic performance of public school students in the pre- and post-pandemic periods.

In this way, it was possible to assess whether the effects caused by the pandemic were, in general, negative or positive and whether these impacts still persist on students in the state of São Paulo.

In a second analysis, we sought to understand the heterogeneity of school performance according to the region of the State of São Paulo.

At the end of the analyses, it was possible to obtain some conclusions.

The database used for the discussion is presented in the "statistics-report-2023" file but can also be accessed directly via the link: https://dados.educacao.sp.gov.br/search/type/dataset

This work was done together with Beatriz Cristine Almeida dos Santos, Isabela Belapetravicius, Natália Elloá Ramos Oliveira and Victor Villela dos Santos.
